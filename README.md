# wiki-API
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a repository for one of my first working APIs.
This has been a long way, but now I'm currently developing this API using Postman and nodeJs.
It's pretty fun to be honest, I never tought I would make it this far, but here I am, learning more and more everyday...
I'll keep going forward.

This API works on the RESTful methodology.
I'm actually trying it locally but I'm submitting it to the Heroku server really soon, stay tuned!.
